# Business_Portfolio
I completed a 21-day internship as part of my 6th semester in B.Sc. (CA &amp; IT) at an IT company, where I developed a Business Portfolio Website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. This project helped me improve my frontend development skills, understand real-world workflows, and learn how to design and deploy a responsive professional website.
